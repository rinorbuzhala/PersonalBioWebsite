		<p>
			I am 18 years old. I am a student of <a href="https://www.universum-ks.org/en/home/" target="_blank">  Universum College </a>studying computer science. We are learning programming and I'm enjoying it. Soon I am gonna be a programmer.
		</p></h3>
		<h4><p>
			So far we learned HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and for this knowledge we have a Personal Website project using only HTML.
		</p>
		<p>

			We are also learning with<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/home" target="_blank"> The Odin Project</a> which is very good, and very understandable platform.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since the beginning of the year I have practiced on platforms like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/" target="_blank"> freeComeCamp</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank"> W3schools, </a> which helped me a lot, also watching videos on Youtube, as well as the tasks given to us, where I have presented them in Assignments.
